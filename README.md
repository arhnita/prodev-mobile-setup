# Mobile Development with React Native & TypeScript

A cross-platform mobile development setup using React Native, TypeScript, NativeWindCSS, and Expo Framework.

## Tech Stack

- **React Native**: Cross-platform mobile framework by Meta
- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript superset for better code quality
- **NativeWindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for React Native styling
- **Expo**: Development platform that simplifies React Native development

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- VS Code (recommended IDE)
- macOS, Linux, or Windows
- Physical device (Android/iOS) with Expo Go installed

## Quick Start

### 1. Install Expo CLI
```bash
npm install -g expo-cli
```

### 2. Create New Project
```bash
npx create-expo-app MyApp
cd MyApp
```

### 3. Start Development Server
```bash
npx expo start
```

### 4. Test on Device
- Scan the QR code with Expo Go app on your phone
- Or open in emulator

## Expo Go Setup

1. Visit [expo.dev/go](https://expo.dev/go)
2. Install Expo Go from:
   - **Android**: Google Play Store
   - **iOS**: Apple App Store
3. Create account or log in
4. Test your apps directly on your physical device

## Key Benefits

- ✅ **Cross-platform**: Write once, deploy to iOS and Android
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Catch errors during development with TypeScript
- ✅ **Rapid Development**: Expo's tools speed up the development process
- ✅ **Efficient Styling**: Utility-first CSS with NativeWindCSS
- ✅ **Over-the-air Updates**: Push updates without app store approval

## Project Evaluation

- Complete projects on time
- Submit all required files
- Generate review link before deadline
- Participate in peer reviews
